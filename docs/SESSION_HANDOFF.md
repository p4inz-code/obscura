# OBSCURA — SESSION HANDOFF
**Date:** v1.0.0 finalized — audit pass, fixture restoration, and two critical bug fixes found via real GitHub CI, all folded in
**Status:** Code, docs, and version numbers all finalized for v1.0.0 (`package.json` bumped to `1.0.0` in both packages, `CHANGELOG.md` has a real `[1.0.0]` entry). **340/340 tests passing locally.** One thing genuinely cannot be confirmed from this sandbox: whether the concurrency fix is actually green on GitHub's real CI runners — that requires an actual push, which requires your credentials, not mine. See CRITICAL section below before assuming this is fully shipped.
**Next milestone:** none after this — v1.0.0 is the target. Push, confirm CI green, tag `v1.0.0`. That's the entire remaining path.

---

## CRITICAL: read this before assuming CI is green

The first push to `github.com/p4inz-code/obscura` failed CI hard: 115 of 340 tests failed. This was **not** a sign the release wasn't ready — it was a real bug that local/sandbox testing structurally could not have caught, because it only manifests under genuine multi-core concurrency, which this development sandbox didn't reliably produce.

**Root cause:** `parser-native.ts`, `tests/harness.ts`, and `packages/cli/src/cli.ts` all built temp file paths from `process.pid`. `process.pid` is shared across every `worker_thread` in one Node process, and Vitest's default pool runs test files concurrently via `worker_threads` — so concurrent test calls raced on the identical file path. Fixed by switching all three to `mkdtempSync()` (atomically unique directory per call — no shared state, so the race is structurally eliminated, not just less likely). Verified directly: a `worker_threads` stress test mimicking Vitest's exact concurrency model failed **30/30** calls against the old code, passed **30/30** against the fix.

**This fix has been verified locally (340/340) but, as of this note, has NOT yet been confirmed on GitHub's actual CI runners.** A log pasted back after the first push still showed the old failure signature (`obscura-parse-3300`, a fixed directory name) — that was the *first* CI run, before the fix was pushed, not a sign the fix doesn't work. Do not assume the fix is confirmed until a *new* CI run (with a different, or no longer fixed-name, temp directory) has been watched going green. If it fails again with the exact same signature — `"Cannot open ... input.luau"` and/or wildly wrong stdout (e.g. one fixture's test showing another fixture's content) — check that the push actually included the fixed files (`grep mkdtempSync packages/core/src/parser-native.ts` should find it) before assuming there's another uncaught instance of the same pattern.

## PASTE THIS PROMPT TO START NEXT SESSION

```
You are the Principal Engineer and Technical Lead of Obscura — a professional, open-source Luau source protection toolkit. Free forever, no premium tier, no subscriptions.

Read this entire handoff before doing anything. This is a continuation of an existing multi-session development arc.

CURRENT STATE: Fully release-ready, 340/340 tests passing locally. IMPORTANT: the first push to GitHub CI failed with 115/340 test failures due to a real concurrency bug in test temp-file handling (process.pid-based paths racing under Vitest's worker_threads pool) — this has been fixed (switched to mkdtempSync, verified with a direct concurrency stress test) but NOT YET CONFIRMED GREEN on GitHub's actual CI. Don't assume CI is passing until you've verified it post-push. If you see "Cannot open ... input.luau" or cross-contaminated test output again, grep the whole repo for `process.pid` + `tmpdir()` — there may be another instance of the same anti-pattern.

0.1b (real WASM parser) DONE, all 11 golden fixtures restored, plugin API frozen. CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, V1_0_0_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md all written and accurate. ESLint/Prettier/CI all wired up and clean.

CRITICAL BUGS FIXED THIS SESSION (read before touching parser.ts, parser-native.ts, harness.ts, or cli.ts's parseSource):
1. WASM parser's cwrap() call used Emscripten's automatic string marshaling, which silently
   UTF-8-re-encoded any non-ASCII source byte before the C++ parser saw it (0xE1 became
   0xC3 0xA1). Fixed by writing raw bytes directly into WASM heap memory (see callParse()
   in parser.ts). tests/parser.test.ts covers this.
2. Test temp-file paths built from process.pid raced under Vitest's worker_threads
   concurrency (process.pid is shared across threads in one process). Fixed by switching
   to mkdtempSync() in parser-native.ts, tests/harness.ts, and cli.ts's parseSource().
   Don't revert either fix without re-reading why.

ROLE: Act as Principal Engineer. Challenge bad ideas. No blind agreement. Think 2-3 years ahead. Optimize for trust, reliability, developer experience. No feature creep. No new architecture unless it solves a real problem.

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- Findings, not process
- Conclusions, not search logs
- Keep status updates under 5 lines
- Bullet points over long paragraphs
- No milestone recaps unless status changes
- Minimize motivational text
- Focus on execution

0.1b COMPLETION NOTES (read this before touching the parser):
- Built via emcc against Luau tag 0.701 (BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_0_1B.md's documented command,
  used as-is, no changes needed).
- The compiled module MUST be named packages/core/native/luau-parser.cjs, NOT .js — with
  "type": "module" in package.json, Node silently resolves a .js file as an empty ES module
  namespace instead of respecting the file's actual `module.exports = ...` (CommonJS). This
  cost real debugging time; don't rename it back.
- parser.ts's WASM_BUILT flag is now true. Don't flip it back without a reason.
- Verified with a real parse() -> generate() round trip AND a full `obscura build` CLI run
  (not just unit tests) — output was byte-identical / correctly transformed.
- The SINGLE_FILE=1 build flag (already in the documented build command) avoids a separate
  known issue: Emscripten <=3.1.6's glue code misdetects Node as browser-like when Node's
  native `fetch` global is present, breaking external .wasm loading. Embedding the wasm as
  base64 sidesteps it entirely. Don't remove SINGLE_FILE=1.

NEXT TASK: v1.0.0 launch is mechanical at this point — see docs/V1_0_0_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md.
1. Push to GitHub (git init/add/commit/push — this sandbox has no GitHub credentials, has to run on your machine).
2. Confirm CI goes green on GitHub's own runners (not just local/sandbox verification).
3. Tag v1.0.0.
4. Whenever you're ready (not blocking v1.0.0): npm publish — exact two-step sequence
   (publish core, swap cli's file:../core dependency to a real semver range, publish cli)
   is fully documented in V1_0_0_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md.

### Key Decisions (All Locked)
- **AST schema v1 FROZEN** — breaking changes require major version bump
- **`AstExprRaw`** — transform-only node, never emitted by parser, generator emits `.rawSource` verbatim
- **`declarationKind`** on `ObscuraLocal` — 6 values: `local|param|self|for_num|for_in|function`
- **`localId: number`** — stable integer IDs assigned by serializer pre-order DFS
- **Normalized locals table** — flat `Record<number, ObscuraLocal>`, all node refs use `localId`
- **Plugin API stable** — `Transform` interface with `name`, `dependsOn`, `apply(ctx, options)`
- **`TransformContext`** — unified interface, `binder()` lazy + cached per step
- **Ordering** — `runPipeline()` validates `dependsOn`, fails loud on wrong order, never silently reorders
- **MIT license** — accepted risk of fork-and-close as a trust/execution bet
- **No `const`/`let` in generated Luau** — generator uses only `local` per Luau conventions
- **Latin-1 fixture reading** — `readFileSync(path, 'latin1')` preserves original bytes

---

## CRITICAL TECHNICAL FACTS

### 0.1b WASM Build (LOCAL MACHINE REQUIRED)
The most important outstanding task. All tests use `obscura_native` binary as stand-in.

```bash
# Prerequisites
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk && ./emsdk install latest && ./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh

# Build steps
cd luau  # the cloned luau-lang/luau tag 0.701
mkdir build-wasm && cd build-wasm
emcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLUAU_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DLUAU_BUILD_WEB=ON
emmake make Luau.ObscuraParser -j4

# Activate in parser.ts
# Set WASM_BUILT = true in packages/core/src/parser.ts
# Copy output to packages/core/native/luau-parser.js

# Activate in tests
# Set WASM_AVAILABLE = true in tests/equivalence.test.ts and tests/snapshots.test.ts
```

The `ObscuraSerializer.cpp` is at `luau/CLI/src/ObscuraSerializer.cpp` — complete, correct, with exception guard. Three bugs were fixed (AstExprInstantiate recursion, AstStatIf elseBody, AstExprTable typo). The C++ code is production-ready.

### Known Bugs Fixed (Important to Know)
1. **`--` comment ambiguity** — `-(-x)` was generating `--x`. Fixed: generator wraps inner unary minus operand in parens when outer is also unary minus
2. **Interpolated string escaping** — `\n` in backtick strings wasn't escaped. Fixed: full per-char encoding in `escapeInterpString()`
3. **String byte semantics** — chars > 0x7e were emitted as UTF-8 bytes, changing string.find() positions. Fixed: `quoteString()` emits `\xNN` for all bytes > 0x7e
4. **Split encoding precedence** — `"he" .. "llo"` without parens causes `#("he") .. "llo"`. Fixed: `encodeSplit()` always wraps in `(...)`
5. **`~` is NOT a Luau operator** — Luau has no infix bitwise operators. Fixed: ConstantTransform uses `bit32.bxor()` library function
6. **Latin-1 fixture files** — `readFileSync('utf-8')` converts 0xe1 → U+FFFD, corrupting byte-string semantics. Fixed: all fixture reads use `'latin1'` encoding

### Parser Architecture
- **AstLocal** — pre-resolved by Luau parser. `AstExprLocal.local` is a pointer to `AstLocal*`, not a name string
- **`upvalue: bool`** on `AstExprLocal` — free closure-capture signal from parser
- **Shadow chain** — `AstLocal.shadow` points to the shadowed outer binding
- **`functionDepth` + `loopDepth`** — numeric, provided by parser, scope boundary detection for free
- **NO infix bitwise operators in Luau** — use `bit32.bxor()`, `bit32.band()`, etc.
- **AstExprInstantiate** — `visit()` does NOT call `expr->visit()`, only visits typeArguments. Safe for LocalCollector (usage site only, not declaration)

## TEST SUITE

**Current verified counts: 313 tests / 11 files in `packages/core`, 27 tests / 1 file in `packages/cli`. 340/340 passing. 0 failures.**

All 11 golden fixtures are restored and verified. This is not "expected once fixtures are restored" — it's the actual, current, re-confirmed state after restoration.

Don't hand-maintain a per-file breakdown table here — it drifted out of date once already this session. To check current counts yourself:

```bash
cd packages/core && npx vitest run --reporter=verbose
cd ../cli && npx vitest run --reporter=verbose
```

`packages/core/tests/` covers: AST generation (all node types, operator precedence), Binder (all declaration kinds, `getfenv`, `_G` writes, dynamic keys, dynamic `loadstring`), Rename/String/Constant/DeadCode transforms (safety, corpus equivalence, determinism), Plugin API (`runPipeline`, `dependsOn` enforcement, lazy binder caching), golden-corpus integration/equivalence tests, and `parser.test.ts` (the real WASM `parse()` path — see the byte-marshaling bug fix above).

`packages/cli/tests/cli.test.ts` covers: CLI basics (version, help, error handling), the full corpus run through the CLI end-to-end, and every flag (`--transforms`, `--no-*`, `--string-encoding`, `--number-encoding`, `--dead-code-rate`, `--seed`, `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `-o`).

### Running Tests
```bash
# Core tests (requires OBSCURA_NATIVE_BIN)
cd packages/core
OBSCURA_NATIVE_BIN=/path/to/luau/build/obscura_native npx vitest run

# CLI tests
cd packages/cli
OBSCURA_NATIVE_BIN=/path/to/luau/build/obscura_native npx vitest run

## POLICIES (ALL LOCKED)

### Regression Test Policy
Every confirmed bug → failing test → fix → passing test, same PR. No exceptions. Tests in `tests/golden/` (behavioral) or `tests/golden-ast/` (AST shape).

### Compatibility Policy
- Supported syntax = what the golden corpus empirically covers
- New syntax support is additive + proven by tests, never assumed
- Breaking changes to supported handling = major version bump

### Performance Targets (Advisory until v0.5.5 Benchmark Suite)
- Parser: < 200ms for 500-line script
- Binder: < 100ms
- Single transform: < 50ms
- End-to-end: < 500ms
- All stages: roughly linear scaling

### Acceptable Use
Obscura is for protecting legitimate developer IP — not for evading Roblox's own moderation/detection systems. No exploit-adjacent features. This is a positioning/governance boundary, not a technical one.

---

## OUTSTANDING TASKS (PRIORITY ORDER)

### ✅ v1.0.0 — everything done except your push + CI confirmation
All of the below are complete: 0.1b WASM build, CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, full audit pass, Plugin API freeze, ESLint+Prettier, all 11 golden fixtures restored, the WASM byte-marshaling bug fix, the CI concurrency bug fix. The only remaining item is mechanical, not technical — see the CRITICAL section at the top of this file.

One legitimately still-open, explicitly non-blocking item: **`AstExprTypeAssertion` source-span passthrough** — currently drops `:: Type` annotation; noted as TODO in `generator.ts`. Not blocking v1.0.0, tracked for later.

### 🟡 Post-v1.0.0
1. **Website** (`apps/website`) — last app, deliberately deferred
2. **Documentation site** (`apps/docs`)
3. **Playground** (`apps/playground`) — requires WASM-portable core
4. **Benchmark Suite** — formal CI performance gates
5. **Luau syntax sync cadence** — monitor upstream `luau-lang/luau` for grammar changes

---

## KNOWN GAPS / NAMED DEFERRALS

- **`getfenv`/`setfenv`** in corpus: present in `11-large-basic` (parse-only). Binder policy: when detected, all renaming disabled globally.
- **Coroutine/task.spawn** in corpus: `05-coroutines` is parse-only. Concurrency-related transforms may need property-based/fuzz testing eventually.
- **String concat O(n²) in ObscuraSerializer.cpp**: 32 `out +=` sites remain after `buildLocalsJson` migration. Advisory until benchmarks flag it.
- **`AstExprInstantiate`** generic args: dropped as passthrough (type-level, not runtime). Correct for v0.1.0.
- **`AstType*` subtree**: 15 node classes, all passthrough in v0.1.0. Full serialization deferred until a transform needs type reasoning.
- **Solo-maintainer burnout**: named risk, not solvable architecturally.
- **MIT fork-and-close risk**: accepted bet, revisit if a real fork gains traction.
